Notes:

Errata/Confusion:
 General:
  01) There isn't a lot of rationale for what functions I'm implementing. I'm blindly following along here
 Target Machine:
  No idea about ABI definitions when running on raw hardware. There should be no ABI right?
 Target Registration:
  01) Lack of "LLVMInitializeSparcTargetInfo" in MSP430 code. Missing function
  02) Not clear where the LLVMInitializeSparcTargetInfo function goes
  03)
